After being seriously disappointed with existing windows alarm apps and programs I developed this program to perform the functionality I would expect in even a basic alarm.  This program allows the use of a playlist as an alarm, to do this the program uses nircmd to change the volume and then runs a playlist through windows media player, in addition this program handles scheduling of alarms in a more reliable way than windows task scheduler seems to be able and is safe to use even in a laptop that may enter hibernation between alarm events as long as that laptop is out of hibernation for more than an hour before the alarm needs to trigger
